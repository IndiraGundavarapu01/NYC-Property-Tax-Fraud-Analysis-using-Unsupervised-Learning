# NYC-Property-Tax-Fraud-Analysis-using-Unsupervised-Learning
# Summary
The city of New York suspects property tax fraud in the properties. To address this, an algorithm is developed to analyze the data and detect potential anomalies using the NY property dataset of 32 records and about a million rows.
The focus would be identifying instances where property values don't match their corresponding characteristics, suggesting underpayment of taxes through misrepresentation. By checking these unusual or suspicious patterns in dollar values and comparing the property values with their corresponding characteristics, detects the anomalies that can be used to alert the city to potential cases of tax fraud. In the process, we used an average of metrics generated from two algorithms and ranked them in descending order to understand which property tax has a higher chance of fraud because of their strangeness. This approach can save the city significant time and resources in manually reviewing records and help to identify and prevent tax fraud.
